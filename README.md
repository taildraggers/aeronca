# Aeronca

Daily aggregator of Aeronca aircraft classified listings from
[Barnstormers.com](https://www.barnstormers.com), published as a static page
(`docs/index.html`) meant to be embedded via `<iframe>` on taildraggers.com.

Controller.com was evaluated but dropped: its search results are only reachable
through an internal client-side widget (not a plain URL), which a headless
browser can't drive reliably for an unattended daily job.

## How it works

- `scraper/barnstormers.py` searches Barnstormers.com for Aeronca listings, follows
  pagination, then visits each listing's detail page to pull out the price, location,
  and posted date (falling back to regex heuristics over the visible text since the
  site doesn't expose structured data). The title is derived from the listing URL's
  own SEO slug, since every detail page shares one generic `<title>`/`<h1>`.
- `main.py` runs the scraper, de-duplicates results, and renders them into
  `docs/index.html` titled **"Other Aeronca Ads on the Web"**, with one row per
  listing: Title (linked to the original ad), Price, Location, Date Posted, and Site
  Posted On. Links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and the page sets a
  `no-referrer` meta policy, so Barnstormers never sees that the click came from
  taildraggers.com.
- `.github/workflows/daily-scrape.yml` runs the whole thing once a day (13:00 UTC),
  commits the regenerated `docs/index.html` if it changed, and can also be triggered
  manually from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`).

## One-time setup: enable GitHub Pages

This repo publishes `docs/index.html` as a plain static file — GitHub Pages just needs
to be pointed at it once:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in this repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`. Save.
4. GitHub will publish the page at `https://taildraggers.github.io/aeronca/`
   (may take a minute or two the first time).

## Embedding on taildraggers.com

```html
<iframe
  src="https://taildraggers.github.io/aeronca/"
  title="Other Aeronca Ads on the Web"
  style="width: 100%; height: 800px; border: 0;"
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

This writes/overwrites `docs/index.html`.

## Notes

- If Barnstormers changes its markup or is briefly unreachable, the run logs will
  show a `[warn]`/`[error]` line pointing at what broke rather than failing silently.
- The scraper identifies itself with a browser-like `User-Agent` and adds a short
  delay between requests to be polite to the site.
